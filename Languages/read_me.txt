If you are interested in translating RQMONEY v. 3.x to other language(s), there is an easy way:

a) Download POEDIT software (e.g. from https://poedit.net)
b) Open POEDIT software
c) Use the button "Create new from template" (find a POT file in the LANGUAGE folder)
d) Translate to your language
e) Save translated file to the LANGUAGE folder (for example, use the name br.po for the Brazilian language)
f) The program also automatically generates the file br.mo)
g) Open RQ Money and test your language

Finally, don't forget to send me both of your language files. I'll add them for other users in the next release.
